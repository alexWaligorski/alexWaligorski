# Hey, I'm Alex!

As an art historian and curator I have analyzed, exhibited, and marveled at digital art pieces – always wondering how the code behind them worked.
For years I have been encouraging kids and adults to take up programming by running [festivals](https://nodeforum.org/) and [workshops](https://www.digitale-welten.org/) for creative coding. 
**Now it's my turn to be brave!**

 ✏️ I have currently graduated from Neue Fische Web Development Bootcamp
 🙋‍♀️ ...and now I am ready to start on my new path as Junior Web Developer
 💬 Ask me about free online coding courses, digital art and dog behavior
